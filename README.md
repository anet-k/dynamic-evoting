# Dynamic E-Voting System

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Dynamic E-Voting System, a blockchain-based electronic voting framework that enables continuous voter engagement throughout a government's tenure.

## Overview

The Dynamic E-Voting System is designed to address the limitations of traditional fixed-term elections by allowing voters to modify their votes at any time, potentially enhancing government accountability beyond initial elections. This system leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and flexible voting platform.

## Key Features

- Continuous voting: Voters can cast and modify their votes throughout the election period
- Blockchain-based: Ensures transparency, immutability, and security of votes
- Robust voter authentication: Utilizes cryptographic techniques for secure voter identification
- Real-time tallying: Provides up-to-date election results
- Privacy-preserving: Maintains voter anonymity while ensuring vote integrity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- Truffle Suite
- Ganache (for local blockchain development)
- MetaMask (for interacting with the DApp)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anet-k/dynamic-evoting.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd dynamic-evoting
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy smart contracts (make sure Ganache is running):
   ```
   truffle migrate
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```
   truffle test
   ```
